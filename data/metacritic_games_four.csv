The aim of the game is to conquer, rule and manipulate the Roman Empire with the ultimate goal of being declared as the ""Imperator"" of Rome. Set in a time when the mighty Roman Empire emerged to conquer the known world against powerful enemies; when gladiators fought to a bloody death in the Coliseum; when Spartacus defied the might of the empire; when Hannibal led his invincible army and his war elephants across the Alps to strike fear into the very heart of Rome itself; and when Julius Caesar finally smashed the Barbarian Gauls. This was a time of brutal confrontation between civilisation and barbarism, and of civil war as the ancient world's only superpower turned on itself. A completely new Total War engine uses innovative technology and groundbreaking design to bring the world of ancient Rome to life to deliver the biggest and most cinematic battles ever seen in a videogame. So the battles in Rome: Total War maintain the epic scale that fans of Total War are used to, but now use high-detailed 3D polygonal troops and allows huge cities to be displayed on the battlefields.

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves. [Electronic Arts]"

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves. [Electronic Arts]"

EI SEKIGAHARA

Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... 

KEITARO MIURA 
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II...

However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. 

NENJI OGATA
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head.

TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMA
A confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar.

TOMI KISARAGI
A flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her...

YUKI TAKAMIYA 
A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend. Despite her disdain for her underhanded allies, she stubbornly seeks the truth when everyone else has something to hide. Tough and caustic, but she's got a protective streak and a sharp mind."

Ironically, it was the Core's ultimate victory, the victory over death itself, that brought about the downfall of its paradise and started the war that would decimate a million worlds. The immortality process, known as ""patterning,"" involved the electronic duplication of brain matrices, allowing the transfer of consciousness into durable machines. Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side. The Arm developed high-powered combat suits for its armies, while the Core transferred the minds of its soldiers directly into similarly deadly machines. The Core duplicated its finest warriors thousands of times over. The Arm countered with a massive cloning program. The war raged on for more than 4,000 years, consuming the resources of an entire galaxy and leaving it a scorched wasteland. [Cavedog Entertainment]"

An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?
Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer.

Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play.

Okay, so how does the game do that?
CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire.

GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss.

SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.

All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.
I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?
The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.
Is there a story?
It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?
How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!
Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!
Anything else?

- The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight.
- Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them.
- Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly.

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.

Story

A long time ago...

In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.
The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.
...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,
a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.

The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.
Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.
And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.
While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.

In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.
To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.

You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.

In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use theseand moreto your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!

In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!

Players take control of Zangetsu, a swordsman from the far east who bears a deep grudge against demonkind and the alchemists who summoned them. Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster. Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the game's many stages. 

Game Flow
Battle through stages filled with fearsome enemies and dangerous traps, each with a massive boss waiting at the end. A chance encounter with a potential ally awaits you after defeating a boss. Will they serve as a trustworthy partner on your perilous journey?

Increase Combat Abilities
You can instantaneously switch between allies you have recruited at any time! Allies have their own life bars, so with each ally you recruit, you're survivability is greatly increased! 

Shortcuts that Only Allies Can Access
Allies have special, unique abilities which allow them to use shortcuts to skip parts of stages or access new areas! There are no special items obtainable by taking the long way around, so take every shortcut you can find! If your allies are out of commission, you'll have to take longer routes, where stronger enemies await! When your life gets low, be sure to switch then out so they'll be available when you need them.

Multiple Episodes
The story is told over the course of multiple episodes. Only the first episode is accessible at the beginning, but more episodes will unlock as you progress through the game. The events that unfold in each episode continue into the next one, so be sure to unlock all the episodes to see the true ending. 

Curse of the Moon 2 had two play styles, ""Veteran"" and ""Casual"". 

Veteran Style
Choose ""Veteran"" style to experiment a difficulty reminiscent of older games. An enemy's sttack knocks the player to their death...something very familiar to retro game fans. 

Casual Style
Even if you're a fan of challenging games, sometimes you just want to take it easy! Casual mode is perfect for times like that. On Casual Style, things are more forgiving. Attacks don't knock the player back and lives are unlimited, alongside other changes. 

Changing Style
Style can be changed when starting a game, loading a save file, or on the Game Over screen."

It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition.

Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.
